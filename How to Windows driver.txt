Installing ULP Driver in Windows with Visual Studio 2022 Debugging
Guide through the process of installing and debugging C++ user-mode printer driver DLL. 
Logical Flow:
      1. Cleanup old printer/driver
      2. Create certificate
      3. Sign catalog file
      4. Install driver package
      5. Add printer driver
      6. Add printer
      7. Verify everything

Prerequisites
•	Visual Studio 2022 with C++ and Windows Driver Kit (WDK) components installed
•	Your printer driver DLL project
•	Administrator privileges on your development machine

Typical Structure:
      C:\ULPDriverDebugPackagePath\
      ├── ULPDriverD.inf  # INF file referencing the DLL
      ├── ULPDriverD.cat  # Catalog file
      ├── ULPDriverD.dll  # VS-built driver
      └── Other files...

Manually Copy DLL to ULPDriverDebugPackagePath if VS post build event didn't do it
Copy these files there:
        .inf file (driver installation instructions)
        .cat file (generated by Inf2Cat, contains file hashes)
        .dll file (Driver)

1. Create an INF file for the printer driver if you haven't already
    Visual Studio output (e.g., x64\Debug\ULPDriver.dll) should be copied to ULPDriverDebugPackagePath.
    The .inf file must reference the DLL in its [DriverInstall] section:
    [DriverInstall]
    CopyFiles=ULPDriverD.dll

2. Generate Catalog File (.cat) file from INF (you've already done this with Inf2Cat)
3. Sign the Catalog File (.cat) 
4. Install the Signed Catalog File
    Disable Signature Enforcement (For Testing Only)
      Enable Debugging Features
      A. Enable Kernel Debugging (Optional)
          If you need to attach WinDbg/KD:      
            bcdedit /debug on
            bcdedit /set TESTSIGNING ON
          Reboot after running these commands.     
      B. Disable Driver Signature Enforcement (Temporarily)
          For early-stage debugging, you can bypass signature checks at boot:
          Press F8 during boot (or Shift + Restart on UEFI systems).
          Select "Disable driver signature enforcement".
5. Install Driver Package 
    C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\
6. Verify Driver Package Installation
7. Add Printer Driver and Printer
8. Verification

How to Run:
powershell
.\SignAndInstallPrinterDriver.ps1 -DriverName "ULPDriver" -DriverPath "C:\DriverPath" -PrinterName "UniLogoPrint 2"

This gives you a complete script that:
Cleans up existing installations
Creates and installs certificates
Signs the driver
Installs the driver package
Adds the printer
Verifies everything worked
